## 1. PennyLane to Qiskit Converter (comparison/Penny_to_qiskit.py)
<div align="justify"> 
  While PennyLane supports converting circuits from Qiskit to its own format, it does not currently offer a method for converting PennyLane circuits back to Qiskit. So I have made one myself!ðŸ˜Š
  Designed to transform KetGPT circuitsâ€”which consist of only eight predefined gatesâ€”this class cannot handle arbitrary gates by default. However, you can easily tailor it by adding Qiskitâ€“PennyLane gate correspondences in the convert_to_qiskit() function. In addition, you can print the comparison table, compares the performance of Qiskit's and PennyLane's transpilers.
